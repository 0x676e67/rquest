An ergonomic, all-in-one HTTP client for spoofing any browser with `TLS`, `JA3`/`JA4`, and `HTTP2` fingerprints.

## Features

- Plain, JSON, urlencoded, multipart bodies
- Header Order
- Redirect Policy
- Cookie Store
- HTTP Proxies
- WebSocket Upgrade
- HTTPS via BoringSSL
- Perfectly Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

## Example

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some optional features. Your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
rquest = "2.0.0"
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use rquest::{Client, Impersonate};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), rquest::Error> {
    // Build a client to impersonate Firefox133
    let client = Client::builder()
        .impersonate(Impersonate::Firefox133)
        .build()?;

    // Use the API you're already familiar with
    let resp = client.get("https://tls.peet.ws/api/all").send().await?;
    println!("{}", resp.text().await?);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL designed for security and efficiency, used by Google Chrome, Android, and Cloudflare. We haven't encountered serious issues with BoringSSL related to the Golang utls [issue](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls/issues/274).

By default, HTTP2 tracing is turned off, reducing performance overhead by 15%. For more information, see [issue](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/issues/713).

## Connection Pool

The client can configure the maximum number of connection pools. Request manages connections based on `Host` and `Proxy`/`IP`/`Interface`, and can flexibly switch between them.

- `Interface` refers to the network interface of the device, such as `wlan0` or `eth0`.

## Root Certificate

By default, `rquest` uses Mozilla's root certificates through the `webpki-roots` crate. This static root certificate bundle is not automatically updated and ignores any root certificates installed on the host. You can disable `default-features` to use the system's default certificate path. Additionally, `rquest` provides a certificate store for users to customize and update certificates.

## Fingerprint

- **JA3/JA4/Akamai Fingerprint**

  Supports custom `TLS`/`HTTP2` fingerprint parameters. Customization is not recommended unless you are highly familiar with TLS and HTTP2, as it may cause unexpected issues.

  `JA3`/`JA4`/`Akamai` fingerprints cannot accurately simulate browser fingerprints due to the sophistication of TLS encryption and the popularity of HTTP2. `rquest` does not plan to support parsing these fingerprint strings for simulation. Users are encouraged to customize the configuration according to their own needs.

  Note: Many `Akamai` fingerprint strings are incomplete. For example, the [website](https://tls.peet.ws/api/all) lacks Priority and Stream ID in the Headers Frame, making it easy to detect. For details, refer to the HTTP2 frame [parser](https://github.com/0x676e67/pingly/blob/main/src/track/inspector/http2.rs).

- **Device Fingerprint**

  In fact, most device models have the same `TLS`/`HTTP2` configuration, except that the `User-Agent` is changed.

## Building

Do not compile with packages that depend on openssl-sys; it links with the same prefix symbol as boring-sys, which can cause [link failures](https://github.com/cloudflare/boring/issues/197) and other problems. Even if compilation succeeds, using both `openssl-sys` and `boring-sys` as dependencies can cause memory segmentation faults.

Install the dependencies required to build [BoringSSL](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-prerequisites)

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake perl pkg-config libclang-dev musl-tools -y

cargo build --release
```

This GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/0x676e67/rquest/blob/main/.github/compilation-guide/build.yml) can be used to compile the project on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.
